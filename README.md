# NoHope.IO
Zombie Survival Game
A multiplayer Phaser 3 game using Typescript, Webpack, node and Socket.io

This is a WIP for a node project for a multiplayer game. Simply run init.bat as an administrator and it will do everything for you.

Here is our big to-do list for the game:

1. Zombie AI pathfinding
2. A simple bitmap representation for tilemap placement
3. Simple game lobby with auto team balancing
4. Keyboard-based movement, mouse based aiming
5. Multi-client action authentication to prevent cheating
6. Tweening to compensate for low tick rate servers
7. Level up bonuses
8. Account currency system
